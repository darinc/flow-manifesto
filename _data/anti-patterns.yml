- title: The Accountability Theater
  emoji: 🚫
  what_it_looks_like: Endless status meetings, detailed time tracking, and micro-reporting that creates the appearance of oversight without actually improving outcomes.
  why_its_wrong: You're measuring activity instead of results, and the measurement overhead often costs more than the value it provides.
  the_better_way: Focus on outcomes and give people autonomy over their methods.

- title: The Busy Badge of Honor
  emoji: 🎭
  what_it_looks_like: Celebrating being "slammed," working late hours, or having back-to-back meetings as signs of importance or dedication.
  why_its_wrong: Busyness is not productivity. Sustainable results come from focused effort, not frantic activity.
  the_better_way: Optimize for impact and protect time for deep work.

- title: The Coordination Overhead Spiral
  emoji: 🔄
  what_it_looks_like: Creating more meetings, status updates, and coordination mechanisms to solve problems caused by... too many meetings, status updates, and coordination mechanisms.
  why_its_wrong: You're treating symptoms, not causes. More coordination usually means unclear ownership or poor system design.
  the_better_way: Clarify ownership, reduce dependencies, and eliminate unnecessary handoffs.

- title: The Decision Hoarding
  emoji: 📋
  what_it_looks_like: Requiring multiple approvals for routine decisions, or escalating every choice to leadership regardless of stakes or reversibility.
  why_its_wrong: You're creating bottlenecks and teaching people to avoid responsibility instead of building judgment.
  the_better_way: Push decisions to the people closest to the information and consequences.

- title: The Everything is Priority One
  emoji: 🎯
  what_it_looks_like: Calling multiple initiatives "urgent" or "critical," refusing to make trade-offs, or constantly shifting priorities without clear reasoning.
  why_its_wrong: When everything is important, nothing is important. People can't optimize their effort or maintain focus.
  the_better_way: Be ruthless about prioritization and communicate the reasoning behind choices.

- title: The Feature Factory
  emoji: 🔧
  what_it_looks_like: Measuring success by how many features you ship rather than customer outcomes or business impact.
  why_its_wrong: You're optimizing for output, not value. More features often create more complexity without solving real problems.
  the_better_way: Focus on customer problems and measure results, not just deliverables.

- title: The Hero Dependency
  emoji: 🏃
  what_it_looks_like: Relying on specific individuals to handle critical tasks because they're the only ones who know how, or celebrating firefighting as heroic.
  why_its_wrong: You've created single points of failure and perverse incentives. Heroes often create the problems they solve.
  the_better_way: Build systems and shared knowledge so anyone can handle routine issues.

- title: The Innovation Theater
  emoji: 🎪
  what_it_looks_like: Hackathons, innovation labs, or "disruption" initiatives that generate excitement but never ship or integrate with real work.
  why_its_wrong: You're treating innovation as separate from daily work instead of building learning into your regular processes.
  the_better_way: Create continuous improvement cycles and empower teams to experiment within their regular work.

- title: The Metric Fixation
  emoji: 📊
  what it looks like: Optimizing heavily for metrics that are easy to measure but don't reflect real value, or gaming metrics to hit targets.
  why_its_wrong: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. You're incentivizing the wrong behaviors.
  the_better_way: Measure what matters and regularly question whether your metrics still serve their purpose.

- title: The Process Sprawl
  emoji: 🗂️
  what_it_looks_like: Creating detailed procedures for edge cases, or requiring the same process for both routine and exceptional situations.
  why_its_wrong: You're optimizing for the worst case and making everything harder. Most processes should handle the 80% case elegantly.
  the_better_way: Design simple processes for common cases and clear escalation paths for exceptions.

- title: The Responsibility Diffusion
  emoji: 🎳
  what_it_looks_like: Having so many people involved in decisions or outcomes that no one feels truly accountable for results.
  why_its_wrong: Shared responsibility often becomes no responsibility. Clear ownership is essential for good outcomes.
  the_better_way: Use models like RACI to clarify who's responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed.

- title: The Synchronous Assumption
  emoji: ⏰
  what_it_looks_like: Defaulting to meetings for all communication, or requiring everyone to be available at the same time for routine coordination.
  why_its_wrong: You're interrupting focused work and assuming everyone has the same schedule and communication preferences.
  the_better_way: Use asynchronous communication as the default and meetings only when real-time interaction adds value.

- title: The Technical Debt Denial
  emoji: 🏗️
  what_it_looks_like: Always prioritizing new features over system maintenance, or treating refactoring as "not real work."
  why_its_wrong: Technical debt compounds like financial debt. Ignoring it makes everything else slower and more fragile.
  the_better_way: Allocate regular time for system health and make technical debt visible to stakeholders.

- title: The Urgency Addiction
  emoji: 🎪
  what_it_looks_like: Operating in constant crisis mode, or treating poor planning as unavoidable urgency.
  why_its_wrong: Constant urgency prevents strategic thinking and leads to burnout. Many "urgent" things aren't actually important.
  the_better_way: Distinguish between urgent and important, and invest time in prevention rather than just reaction.

- title: The Vanity Project
  emoji: 🎨
  what_it_looks_like: Pursuing initiatives because they're interesting, prestigious, or personally important to leadership rather than because they serve customers or the mission.
  why_its_wrong: You're spending resources on internal preferences rather than external value. Someone's pet project rarely creates lasting impact.
  the_better_way: Align all work with clear customer outcomes and business objectives.
